# Exercise 1: Create Your First Mobile App

## 🎯 Objective
To set up the first mobile application using the **Expo Router** template, understand the structure of a React Native app, and document the scaffolding and reset process.

### 🧩 Observations from `npm run reset-project`
When running the reset command, the CLI prompted:
Choosing **Y** moved my current app folder to `/app-example` and generated a new `/app` directory with the default Expo Router layout.  
This effectively reset my project while preserving old code for reference.  
After the reset, the app rebuilt successfully and loaded on Expo Go without issues.
